Biography
=========
I am a senior student of Xu Teli Elite Class (or [Xu Teli College](http://admission.bit.edu.cn/colleges/xtl.html)), Beijing Institute of Technology ([BIT](http://www.bit.edu.cn/)). My major is Control Science and Engineering and I will graduate in June of 2019. Since the end of 2016, I have become a member of Key Laboratory of Complex System Intelligent Control and Decision (National Key Laboratory) and my advisor is [Prof. Xia Yuanqing](http://ac.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsdw/20150206132638749920/20150206132641418489/index.htm). My research interest includes deep learning, deep reinforcement learning, mobile crowdsensing game and control theory.

Besides, I am also a co-founder of [Aifore](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/cUBhVSVa46Yoci6ImF6rSQ), a health science and technology company established by a group of undergraduate students from China. Aifore aims at employing cutting-edge technology of artifical intelligence and data science to help people reduce the risk of suffering from type-II diabetes in daily life. We hope that one day, everyone can embrace a healthy lifestyle and enjoy a happy life.
