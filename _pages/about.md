Biography
=========
I am an undergraduate student of Xu Teli Elite Class (or Xu Teli College), Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT). My major is Control Science and Engineering and I will graduate in June of 2019. Since the end of 2016, I have become a member of Key Laboratory of Complex System Intelligent Control and Decision (National Key Laboratory) and my advisor is Prof. Xia Yuanqing. My research interest includes deep learning, deep reinforcement learning, mobile crowdsensing game and control theory.

Besides, I am also a co-founder of Aifore, a health science and technology company established by a group of undergraduate students from China. Aifore aims at employing cutting-edge technology of artifical intelligence and data science to help people reduce the risk of suffering from type-II diabetes in daily life. We hope that one day, everyone can embrace a healthy lifestyle and enjoy a happy life.


Brief Introduction of Xu Teli Class
===================================
Students in Xu Teli College can pursue their PHD careers at BIT directly after undergraduate education, if and only if they keep working hard and never fail in any courses. Otherwise, they will be ruled out of Xu Teli College. 

During the freshman year, students of Xu Teli College are required to complete the study of main courses from Mathematics College, Physic College and Computer Science College, such as mathematical analysis, advanced algebra, analytic geometry, differential equation theory, general physics, C programming language, etc. 

During the sophomore year, students who "survive" in the freshman year can enter into the study of sophomore year, where they can choose their interesting fields ranging from fundamental science to engineering science. During this year, they need to study fundamental courses of their interesing fields. They are also required to finish their study of academic English (4 semestars, 16 points total). 

During the junior year, fortunate "survivors" of the second year can gain admission to their interesting laboratories of their fields  (or relevant fields) and start their academic careers! Meanwhile, they are required to accomplish both advanced cources of their major fields and the selected courses related to their academic researches or arranged by their mentors.

Finally, during the senior year, students who still stay at Xu Teli College can obtain their PHD admission directly in their interesting laboratories. Or they can choose to give up and apply graduate programs of other universities.
