Biography
=========
Hi, everyone! I am Meiyu Zhong, a last-year master student of Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California. Previously, I graduated from Shanghai University as an outstanding graduate, majoring in Electrical Engineering. 
Education
=========
* Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California, 08/2019-Present
  * Major in Electrical Engineering
  * GPA: 3.7/4.0
* Xu Teli Elite Class, Beijing Institute of Technology, 09/2015-06/2019
  * Major in Electrical Engineering
  * Major GPA: 3.77/4.0

Research Experience
===================
08/19/2019-Present | USC Deconstructing Distributed Deep Learning | Advisor: Leana Golubchik
* Problem Statement: How to offend a hide and strong attack with changing several labels or hyperparameters with just one shoot
* Solution: The key to solve this kind of attack is to find how, where and what the attack perform, the contribution of my work is the following:
  * Evaluated the whether the initial meta-training by benign users do not include correctly-labeled examples of backdoor classes 
  * Investigated the case where backdoor classes are present, with correct labels, also during fine-tuning.
  * Explored the effects of additional supervised fine-tuning with the different hyperparameters
  * Proposed a defense mechanism applied by each benign user: used just a few labels to predict unseen labels when evaluating the federated model
* Results: This kind of defense mechanism can actually totally eliminate the backdoor attack from federated users
