Project 1: Research on Mars Visual Navigation Algorithm 
=======================================================
* Belongs to “Research on Navigation and Guidance Control of Precise Landing on Planetary Surface”, 973 National Basic Research Program of China
* Worked as the main researcher of this sub-project
  * Designed a novel deep neural network architecture with double branches to plan path for planetary rovers directly from orbital images
  * Demonstrated that the proposed deep neural network architecture achieved better performance and faster convergence than the existing ones and generalized well to unknown environment.
  * Included the research results in Prof. Yuanqing Xia’s monograph, and responsible for the compilation of related contents.
